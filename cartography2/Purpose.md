# Cartography 2.0 - An Overview

Why we need a new approach  
  
From what we could see, there are at least five basic problems that are encountered when publishing material about emerging mapping technology: 
(1) SPEED: The world of Web-based mapping is evolving at light speed and textbooks are at least 2 or 3 years out-of-date by the time they reach students. That is a lifetime online (e.g., Google Maps is only 4 years old!) and rapidly emerging areas like *[location-based services][1]* and *[crowd sourcing][2]*—which are profoundly re-shaping and expanding our notion of ‘mapping’—are terms that weren’t even coined when today’s textbooks were being written. No doubt, the next big thing(s) are happening now, as you read this.

(2) LEARNING DEMANDS ‘LIVE’ EXAMPLES: Static screen captures of animated and interactive maps are a very poor substitute for the real thing. Imagine trying to share the joy of using [Google Earth][3] with two or three black-and-white screen captures? It is critical that people can get their hands on real working examples if they want to learn how to make great dynamic maps and understand how people use them. In the classroom, we assign URLs like an English teacher assigns novels; to become an expert in a field you have to immerse yourself in the works of that field. A CD-ROM insert in a textbook separates content from examples and is just as old as the book itself. The Web is “in the wild” and we have to venture into it to understand it (fellow cartographer [Rob Edsall][4] has been saying this for years).

(3) BUILDING TWO-WAY LEARNING: Most of the mapping projects we've been involved with require input from a handful of people with a wide array of domain expertise. Ensuring that we tap into the knowledge based of this diverse group is essential for complete success of the project, but often is simply not feasible. What is needed with Cartography 2.0, then, is a way to facilitate an interactive learning community where folks post questions, comments, and links in response to our own contributions (i.e., a community where everyone is allowed to interact with each other). This idea is nothing new in online education and these kinds of ‘learning communities’ are at the very heart of the [Web 2.0 ethic][5]. 

In both subtle and apparent ways, our university classrooms are already two-way learning communities. Despite our best efforts to stay on top of things, we have found that our students are routinely ahead of us on emerging concepts and technologies. In this way, our students act to keep us current, while we act to synthesize this input and integrate the state-of-the-art into extant frameworks, removing from our lecture notes what is now outdated. We expect a similar reciprocity with the learning community implemented in Cartography 2.0, where everyone plays the role of both teacher and student.
