## Neocartraphy Wiki

This project is the public collaboration for editing the [neocartoraphy wiki](https://github.com/ajturner/neocartography/wiki). 

Since github doesn't support _pull requests_ for Wikis, I decided to follow [this process](http://fusiongrokker.com/post/how-you-can-contribute-to-taffy-documentation) for enabling people to fork, modify, and submit pull requests that I will then merge back into the [full wiki](https://github.com/ajturner/neocartography/wiki).

### Process

To contribute to the [neocartoraphy wiki](http://github.com/ajturner/neocartography/wiki):

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit/add/remove
3. Submit a Pull Request to this project.
4. When merged, [I](https://github.com/ajturner) will then push into the [neocartoraphy wiki](http://github.com/ajturner/neocartography/wiki)

Thanks!
