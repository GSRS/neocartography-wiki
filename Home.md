## About

The design of maps, navigation, and wayfinding have been evolving throughout the span of human history. We have constantly developed new techniques, concepts and technologies to understand our place in the world and how we convey that to other people. Maps provide a common, language independent, and visceral communications tool which taps into our basic cognition of visual pattern detection.

Most recently, digital technology provides a revolutionary new capability to generate and access on-demand, dynamic and personalized interfaces to geospatial information. Traditional techniques of map creation, portrayal and annotation are no longer restricted to the physical constraints imposed by static media. 

It is necessary to reconsider and evolve the methods of cartography in order to properly and effectively use this technology to improve people's understanding of place and transit. It is not possible to apply existing terminology, methodology, or practice without adapting to these fundamentally different capabilities. Merely [looking](http://cartography.oregonstate.edu/demos/CompositeMapProjection) [at](http://areyousafeatlanta.com/) [a](http://www.buzzfeed.com/angelameiquan/32-imaginative-and-beautifully-designed-maps-70fn) [few](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhhWkJxSSyg) [recent](http://hint.fm/wind/) [examples](http://pinterest.com/shashashasha/mapping/) [illustrates](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/oct/01/first-world-war-royal-navy-ships-mapped) the need to have a conversation on new terminology and approaches.

Neocartography is the study of new techniques of geospatial visualization, interaction, and engagement which focus on digital, web, and mobile technology as unique interfaces. This project hopes to collaboratively evolve and create the concepts of cartography that apply to digital technology. This includes developing a nomenclature of new interface components (e.g. Zoom bars, InfoWindow, et al.), techniques for new capabilities (e.g. animation, hovering, pan and zoom), and affordances of new technology (e.g. mouse and touchscreen input, geolocated mobile phones), amongst many more.

There are two sections to this project: a Wiki of articles, best practices, and case studies; and a Code Repository of implementation examples and experiments demonstrated the documented concepts of the Wiki. To contribute you can edit the Wiki, fork and submit pull requests of examples, or add links to [pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in/t:neocartography), [pinterest](http://pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=neocartography) or [delicious](https://delicious.com/search?p=neocartography) tagged 'neocartography'. 

## Sections

This repository has also captured the now defunct [Cartography2 website](Cartography2). It was the beginning of a series of articles on interactive cartography that will continue and grow here.
